# The-Coupled-Crystal-Plasticity-and-Stochastic-Cluster-Dynamics-model-with-Qianran-Yu-
The CP/SCD simulation package contains a computer code written in C++. It couples the 0-dimensional SCD method with a general crystal plasticity formulation. We have used the code to study mechanical properties change of W and Fe metals during irradiation.
